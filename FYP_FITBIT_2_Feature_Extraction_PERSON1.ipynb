    "According to the authours, wearable fitness trackers like FITBIT and WITHINGS uses photoplethysmography (PPG) to detect a pulse. Coloured or IR LED light were directed at the skin surface and photodetectors senses the changes in blood volume under the skin via the light reflected. In comparison, the peaks to peak (P-P) interval correlates to the R-R intervals. From Fitbit, the Intra-day Heart Rate is reported every 5 seconds (lowest granuity) in terms of beats per minute. It can be interpreted that 60 divided by the 5 Sec Intra-day HR will be the averaged P-P interval in seconds for the pulses in the 5 second window."

    "Normally, it is more common for healthcare professionals to use Normal-Normal (N-N), which is the Inter-Beat Interval (IBI), or the R-R interval that is normalised by healthcare professionals. This normalisation process includes removing or adjusting the data that may be \"abnormal\". It is not everyday that a heart specialist would be able to monitor for all of us. Thus, it will be more accessable to calculate base off R-R intervals. In addition, the P-P intervals provided by commercial trackers are highly unlikely not adjusted as well. Hence, it is only reasonable to consider P-P intervals as R-R intervals."
